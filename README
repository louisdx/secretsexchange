Simple secret exchange
======================

This project consists of a website and an offline application
(written in Qt) which perform a simple Diffie-Hellman secret
exchange. A collection of parameters (prime and group generator)
are included.

The intention is for the communication to happen via copy/pasting in
public online chats or instant messaging. After the handshake, a
simple line protocol (XOR of a padded message with the shared secret)
allows for the encryption of a short message.

Prolonged use is almost certainly vulnerable to cryptanalysis; this is
best used for a one-off message (e.g. for commmunicating a private IP
address).
